# Platformer-Test-January-2022-V2

Same level as the previous release except with new features:

- Horizontal dashes can be executed in the ground or in the air
- UI on the bottom-left of the screen shows the amount of dashes and air jumps the player has left
- Two enemies: one that follows you and one that goes back and forth between two positions

To test the level, download the zip file and launch the .exe file.
